# ForestCast

ForestCast is a comprehensive deforestation prediction system that leverages historical satellite map data, computer vision, and time series analysis to monitor and forecast forest loss. Designed for environmental monitoring and conservation efforts, the system provides actionable insights into deforestation risk areas.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Automated data pipeline for historical satellite imagery
- Image preprocessing and geospatial feature extraction
- Time series modeling for change detection
- Predictive analytics for future deforestation risk assessment
- Scalable architecture leveraging cloud resources

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- **Python** for system logic and data handling
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for machine learning and deep learning models
- **GDAL / Rasterio** for geospatial data processing
- **Cloud Platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)** for scalable data storage and computation
